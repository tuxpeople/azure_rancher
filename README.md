# Azure Rancher

Scripts I made to get me a Rancher installation on azure quickly. With Let's Encrypt. Dirty code. You shall not use it :-P

Needs Azure CLI installed and logged in.

``./bootstrap.ch``

See head of bootstrap.sh for settings.

This has no tests, no security checks and error handling. You've been warned!

A deployment takes approx. 17min
